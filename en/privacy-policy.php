          <p>The controller has integrated a contact form from gratis-kontaktformular.de on its website. Gratis-kontaktformular.de is a German website that offers free contact forms for use on websites. A contact form collects data entered by a data subject and forwards this data to the website operator.</p>
          <p>A contact form is used to enable easy contact between a website user and the website operator.</p>
          <p>Contact details for gratis-kontaktformular.de can be found here: <a href="https://www.gratis-kontaktformular.de/impressum">Contact Details</a></p>
          <p>The purpose of the contact form is to facilitate easy communication with us. Gratis-kontaktformular.de provides a contact form generator on its website, which we used to create a contact form. The following input fields were available for selection: salutation, first name, last name, street, house number, postal code, city, phone, message.</p>
          <p>We selected only the input fields we deem absolutely essential to adequately respond to your inquiry. These mandatory fields are marked with an asterisk (*).

By correctly filling out the contact form and clicking the submit button, the form contents are sent to the email address we provided.</p>
          <p>Gratis-kontaktformular.de uses SSL encryption (HTTPS) to transmit the form contents after submission, ensuring data security.</p>
          <p>The collected data are not shared with third parties. The collected data are not stored but are directly forwarded to the email address provided by the contact form creator.</p>
          <p>Gratis-kontaktformular.de uses the reCAPTCHA function from Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. This function primarily serves to distinguish whether an input is made by a natural person or abusively through automated processing. The service includes sending the IP address and any additional data required by Google for the reCAPTCHA service, in accordance with Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, based on our legitimate interest in verifying the authenticity of actions on the internet and preventing abuse and spam.</p>
          <p>Google LLC, based in the USA, is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield, which ensures compliance with the EU’s data protection standards.</p>
